Hello! 👋
My name is <a href="https://github.com/himeshx">```Himesh Mohapatra```</a> 
The Holiday Countdown Web App is a delightful and interactive project developed using a combination of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. It offers users a fun and engaging way to keep track of the countdown to three major holidays: Christmas, New Year's Eve, and Easter. This project serves as a festive reminder of these special occasions, adding a touch of excitement and anticipation to the holiday season.
